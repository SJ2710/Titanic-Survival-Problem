# Titanic-Survival-Problem
This repository contains my first problem solved as a newbie in the field of ML. Here I attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features such as age, sex etc.
I have used few of the classification algorithms to accurately predict the survival outcome of a passenger.
This project had initially been done as a part of Udacity's ML Nanodegree (titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb) where I implemented Decision Tree Classifier and obtained an accuracy of 80%.
Then, I tried doing this problem from scratch(titanic_survival_problem.ipynb), got the data from kaggle and started solving it step by step and used Gradiant Boosting model to get an F1 score of 87%.
